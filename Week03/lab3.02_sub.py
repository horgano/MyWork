# Input reads 2 number(in string format) and we have to convert to int
# so we can perform mathematical operations

int1 = int(input("Enter 1st integer: "))
int2 = int(input("Enter 2nd integer: "))

# To subtract 2nd number from 1st number
answer = int2 - int1

print (f'{int2} minus {int1} equals: {answer}')
